## YAY! While loops!

This took longer than the previous coding assignments, but I still got it to work relatively quickly. I'm _pretty_ sure that it works with runTime set to any integer, but I didn't have time to double check everything. A tip for future me is to think more creatively about combining the different functions we've been learning about, because I was stuck for quite a while before I remembered that I could use if... & else if... & else blocks within the while loop too. Here is a sample output:
