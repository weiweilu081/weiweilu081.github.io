## YAY! If blocks!

This was not bad at all! Below I've included a code output with int temperature = 100 (I think). I was totally traumatized from living in Boston over the summer and how INSANELY unbearable the heat wave was. There's not really any tips for future me except for the fact that I found it really helpful to have fully looked over the slides before beginning on this assignment, so I'll definitely make sure to keep doing that moving forward.
