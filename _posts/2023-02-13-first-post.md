## Hi, welcome! 

Pleased to make your acquaintance! I'm Weiwei, a current senior studying sociology and comparative literature. I've had very limited programming experience that has been largely lost to the years, but I do (and love) sewing & making things! I'm hoping to learn basic programming in this class as well as get a chance to be creative with the final project. I bet you didn't know that one of my favourite plants is the dandelion, but now you do!

Here's a random photo of my friends and I doing a puzzle from my downloads folder, as a little treat :)

### Ding Dong! You've got mail

**You made it!** I hope you're having a lovely day!
