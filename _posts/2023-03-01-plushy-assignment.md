## Got Side-tracked by Covid, but We Made It!

Definitely not my best work by far... But I really wanted to get this out of the way. This project is a semi-ugly plushy that utilizes digital circuits to allow interactive actions: pressing a button enables the 3 LED lights sewn on the plushy to light up, so long as the switch is also on. 

I learned a lot about working with conductive threads and arduino parts to create simple circuits because the experinece was quite hands-on. One concrete tip I would give my past self is to properly prototype the circuit â€” before I was on a time crunch, I completely forgot to make an alligator prototype before diving straight into the sewing. While I did succeed by the end, I did mess up several times due to misunderstandings of how the circuit is supposed to work.
