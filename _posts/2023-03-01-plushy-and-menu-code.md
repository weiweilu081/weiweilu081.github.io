## Two Coding Assignments in One Post — What A Treat!

The plushy redux assignment replicates the behaviour of the circuit on the plushy by checking the boolean value stored in each LED variable in the code and printing OFF or ON.

The menu assignment gives the user a meal option from either a regular or secret menu depending on the integer input of numberChoice and menuOption. If numberChoice is even, the user will only get meals from the regular menu; when numberChoice is odd, the user will only get meals from the secret menu. 

To be honest, I'm not entirely sure if I did either of these assignments correctly since I've had an insane past few days — but they do both use if blocks, and both code solidly works! One tip for future me is to PLEASE LEARN TO PRIORITIZE YOUR TIME BETTER so I can make it to TA hours next time.
