## Weiwei's Project: Fishing Game Scarf

Have you ever wanted to go out fishing, but the river is contaminated with sewage? Fret no further! In the comfort of your home (and around your own neck), you could simulate the wonderous adrenaline rush of catching a fish... under the right conditions, of course. When it is too light out, the sun embroidered on the back of the scarf will flash, indicating that it is too sunny and the waters are too shallow. When it is dark out, however — simulating that you are in deeper waters — you can choose to catch either of the fish, which will flash random, pretty colours as they are caught!

### Materials List

2 RGB LEDs
1 light sensor
Conductive thread
1 lilypad arduino
1 battery power
conductive thread
Embroidery floss 
Several snap-closure sewable metal buttons 
3 pieces of blue felt fabric that joins together to be ~3 ft long
Thread, scissors, needle

### Revised Paper Prototype

Screenshot of your revised paper prototype of your project

Focus on the components and how you'll connect them in a circuit

Must be legible! Digital images work well (i.e., grab component images from the Product WebsiteLinks to an external site., then connect them in PowerPoint or other image editing software).

Will need to be a .JPG, .PNG, .GIF, etc in order to appear on your course website.

Should look professional/polished.
