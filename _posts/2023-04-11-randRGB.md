## Finally!

I couldn't get it to work before class, oops. But I finally got it! A tip for my future self would be to really commit to writing out the pseudo code before I even start typing anything â€” the parts I got stuck on (getting the random colours to stay the same while the button is being pressed) could've probably been prevented with a bit more logic and code tracing.
