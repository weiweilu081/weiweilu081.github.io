## It's Finished!!!

The sewing sample took (surprisingly) less time than I anticipated; but I've also been mending clothes and sewing stuff regularly ever since the pandemic, so maybe I'm just a veteran at this.

While I thought I did a pretty good job overall, I didn't realized how helpful guidelines would prove to be. The satin stitch half of the big W turned out a little wonky, partly because I didn't do the best job tracing over the template. Moving forward, I'll be sure to begin every embroidery project with proper guidelines.

(P.S. Sorry! I wanted to preserve my thread and didn't realize I was supposed to disconnect each stitch until I properly read the assignment description towards the end. But only two of the designs are connected â€” it's not *that* bad in the grand scheme of things, I think!)
