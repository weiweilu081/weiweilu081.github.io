## Functions!

Done! A tip for my future self would be to think through the structure of code first: for example I wrote out each individual dash and dot for every letter at first before realizing I could just include more functions to make code easier to digest. I'm not sure if I could've written it in a more sophisticated way that involved use of parameters too, but it was great practice for sort of getting the hang of functions.
