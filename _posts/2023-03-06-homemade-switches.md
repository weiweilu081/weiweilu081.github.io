## YAY! It works!

This took no time at all, and I'm glad I'm really getting the hang of sewing with conductive thread & making physical circuits! I wish I had any intellectual capacity to have made a more complex design for the switches (or remembered to put the battery on the back of the design), but considering I'm currently in the thick of a catastrophic breakup, this is the best I could've pulled off. A piece of advice for future me would be to put more effort into making a sturdier fabric button â€” I didn't realize how easily the fabric becomes distorted with the satin stitch of conductive threads.
