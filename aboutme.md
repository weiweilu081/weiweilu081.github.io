Hello! My name is Weiwei and I am taking a CS class at Williams for the first time. One thing about me is that I am by no means a STEM major. Being allowed to put my creativity as an artist to practice, however, feels infinitely appealing. Having not touched any programming languages in the past 5 years, Iâ€™m looking forward to refreshing some of the rustiest skills I have while exercising my strengths.
